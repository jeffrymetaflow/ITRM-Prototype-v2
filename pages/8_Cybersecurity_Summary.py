    - **Detect:** Identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event in a timely manner.
    - **Respond:** Take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.
    - **Recover:** Maintain plans for resilience and restore capabilities or services impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.

Please rate your cybersecurity maturity against the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** categories. Use the scale below to self-assess how well your organization addresses each area:

- **1 – Not Started**: No formal practices or policies in place.
- **2 – Initial**: Informal practices exist but are not documented or consistent.
- **3 – Developing**: Documented practices exist, but only partially implemented.
- **4 – Managed**: Practices are implemented and actively managed.
- **5 – Optimized**: Practices are well-integrated and continuously improved.
